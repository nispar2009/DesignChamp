    <div class="section-bg">
        <p>
            The Indian National Army (INA) was created by <a href="people.html" class="link">Subhas Chandra Bose</a>.
            Due to his differences with <a href="people.html" class="link">Gandhi</a> in terms of violence/non-violence, he had left the Congress.
            When WWII broke out, he escaped to Germany.
            Later, he reached Japan and started the Indian National Army (AKA "Azad Hind Fauj").
            They marched through Burma (now "Myanmar") and planted the Indian flag in Manipur.
            But, when Japan was defeated in WWII, the INA was also disbanded.

        <p>
            The Indian National Congress (INC) was founded to address the need for a political organization that would unify the people and spread political awareness.
            Allan Octavian Hume played a key role in the formation of the INC.
            Its first session was held in 1885.
            It continued to play a majo role in negotiations with the British to settle the conflict with regard to the Simon COmmission, the Government of India Act, and more.
