            <p>
                The Revolt of 1857 was the first widespread uprising against the British.
                It was known by many names.
                After the Revolt was suppressed, it came to be known as the "Sepoy Mutiny".
                Currently, some refer to it as the "First War of Indin Independence".
                This rebellion saw the end of the rule of the English East India Company (EEIC).

                Over the years, so much anger had built up against the British that all that was needed to spark off a
                war
                was one more problem.
                This problem was manifested as the Enfield rifle.
                A rumor spread that the cartridges of the Enfield rifle were coated with the tallow of sacred animals.
                At one point in time, a soldier of the 34<sup>th</sup> Bengal Infantry&mdash;<a href="people.html"
                    class="link">Mangal Pandey</a>&mdash;shunned
                this gun and shot his superior.

            <p>
                After Mangal Pandey's execution with regards to the Enfield rifle, 85 other soldiers gave up their guns.
                They were also imprisoned but were freed by their colleagues.
                Later, all these soldiers reached Delhi and Meerut and occupied these regions.
                Bahadur Shah Zafar was declared the emperor.
                Nana Sahib of Kanpur, Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, and Begum Hazrat Mahal of Lucknow also joined the
                rebels.

                The British needed their top commanders to suppress the Revolt.
                After the Revolt was crushed, India came under the direct rule of the British crown under Queen
                Victoria.
